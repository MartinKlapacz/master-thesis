iCharge:

US:
ICD10 for diagnoses
CPT for services and procedures


Problem of the EHR:
missing support of the existing electronic billing workflow:
 - billing was done in a separate system -> separate patient lists, difficult to verify supporting documentation for each bill

Methods: iCharge = Separate program communicating with EHR's API (ObjectsPlus)

 - accessed from the inpatient EHR with look and feel of existing system
 - closely integrated with the doc workflow
 - link note/doc with bill -> automatic association of bill with supporting documentation
 - note history -> review unsubmitted bills
 - billing statistics (num of bills, avg. num of diagnoses per bill)
 - fast and efficient search of diagnoses (select from previous diagnoses, personal presets, frequently used)
    - full catalog search contains suggestions derived textual matches
 - use of  IMO (Northbrook, IL) provides an extensive terminology of physician-friendly terms that are mapped to ICD code


Discussion:
 - high importance of seamless integration into existing workflow
