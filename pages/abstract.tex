This thesis introduces a novel rule-based billing framework for statutory and private medical treatments.
Central to the system is a JSON-based domain-specific rule language designed for billing experts to encode diverse rules effectively, including GOÃ„, EBM, and OPS.
Integrated into a Java Spring Boot microservice, this framework uses the rules to produce accurate billing codes for medical treatments.
Developed in collaboration with Avelios Medical, the project highlights the importance of structured data in automated billing.
The research involved interviews with experts and participation in a private billing seminar, leading to the identification of 17 information sources and 41 condition types for the rule language.
While effective in generating billing codes for complex treatments, the framework's limitations stem from the untracked information in Avelios Medical's software, pointing to areas for future development.
This work significantly contributes to medical billing, offering a data-driven solution for a complex domain.
