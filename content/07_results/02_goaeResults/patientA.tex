\subsection{Patient Case 1: Multiple spine infiltrations due to back pain with obesity}\label{subsec:patient-a---multiple-spine-infiltrations-due-to-backpain-with-obesity}
The patient is a 57-year-old female suffering from chronic back pain.
The patient has two other visits with the same issue concerning back pain and was previously diagnosed with the so-called facet syndrome (\mete{M47.2}).

\paragraph{Anamnesis}
The anamnesis stage reveals that the patient had two previous visits with the same issue concerning back pain, where she received a diagnosis of the so-called facet syndrome (\mete{M47.2})

\paragraph{Physical Examination}
In the physical examination stage, the doctor conducts several examinations.
The doctor performs a spine palpation and examines the patient's spine mobility.
She performs a mobility test for the thoracic and lumbar spine and detects existing mobility issues.
She enters the tou into the \code{mobilityTestThoracicSpine} and \code{mobilityTestLumbarSpine} blocks.
Additionally, the practitioner notes down the patient's nutrition status, leading to the patient suffering from obesity.

\paragraph{Procedures}
The previous stages have revealed chronic back pain due to a diagnosed facet syndrome, missing neurological issues, and obesity.
That is why she decided to perform non-operative and conservative treatment, namely a spine infiltration.
A spine infiltration applies to chronic and acute back pain issues to reduce the pain.
As the patient suffers from facet syndrome, the doctor decides to perform facet injections in the spine infiltration procedure.
In a Facet Infiltration, the performer performs direct injections into the spine joints instead of the surrounding muscles.

She performs the following injections:
\begin{itemize}
    \item one nerve root injection on the left side of TH2 in the thoracic spine
    \item one facet injection on both sides of TH4/5 in the thoracic spine
    \item one facet injection on the right side of L1/2 in the lumbar spine
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Difficulties and Inconveniences}
Overweight individuals have a thicker subcutaneous fat layer, making targeting veins, muscles, and joints more difficult.
Additionally, doctors may need special syringes with longer needles to penetrate the fat layer to reach the underlying joint.

\subsubsection{Expected Results}
The billing for the treatment should compensate the doctor for the performed examinations and every single spine infiltration.
The challenging condition of the spine infiltration caused by the patient's nutrition status is a valid justification for a multiplier applied to the spine infiltration billing code.
The physical examination consisted of an orienting neurological examination and multiple spine mobility tests.


\subsubsection{Actual Results}
The framework could not derive \goa{1} due to the issues already described in paragraph \ref{par:goa-1}.
The framework successfully derived \goa{5} showed in listing \ref{lst:goae-5-rule}, triggered by the spine palpation.

The framework derived \goa{255} with the correct quantity of four.
Rule \ref{lst:goae-255-rule} matched due to the \code{spineInfiltration} procedure block.
The rule engine also computed the quantity by evaluating each child function for the corresponding localization field in the \code{spineInfiltration} object and returned the correct quantity.
Additionally, the framework detected the patient's obesity as a challenging factor for the infiltration,
successfully deriving the multiplier justification in listing \ref{lst:mj-obesity}.
