\subsection{Patient A - Multiple spine infiltrations due to back pain with obesity}\label{subsec:patient-a---multiple-spine-infiltrations-due-to-backpain-with-obesity}
Patient A is a 57-year-old female suffering from chronic back pain.
The patient has two other visits with the same issue concerning back pain and was diagnosed with the so called facet syndrome (\mete{M47.2}).

\paragraph{Anamnesis}


\paragraph{Physical Examination}
In the physical examination stage the doctor conducts several examinations.
The doctor firstly checks for neurological issues.
She performs a orienting neurological examination and examines the posture and stand of the patient.
In both examinations she does not detect anything conspicuous.

Next, she examines the patient's spine mobility.
She performs a mobility test for the thoracic spine (\code{MobilityTestThoracicSpineBlock}) and the lumbar spine (\code{mobilityTestLumbarSpineBlock}) and detects mobility issues.


Additionally, the practitioner notes down the patient's nutrition status (\code{NutritionStatusBlock}), leading to the results that the patient suffers from obesity.

\paragraph{Procedures}

The previous stages have revealed chronic back pain due to a diagnosed facet syndrome, missing neurological issues and obesity.
This is why she decides to perform non-operative and conservative treatment, namely a spine infiltration.
A spine infiltration is applicable to chronic and acute back pain issues to reduce the pain.
As the patient suffers from the facet syndrome the doctor decides to perform facet injections in the spine infiltration procedure.
In a Facet Infiltration, the performer makes direct injections into the spine joints instead of the surrounding muscles.
She makes in total four injections, one nerve root injection and two facet injections into the thoracic spine and one facet injection into the lumbar spine.

\paragraph{Difficult Conditions}
Overweight individuals have a thicker layer of subcutaneous fat, making locating veins, muscles and joins more difficult.
Additionally, doctors may need special syringes with longer needles to penetrate the fat layer to reach the underlying joint.


\subsubsection{Expected Results}
The billing for the treatment of patient A should compensate the doctor for the performed examinations and each single spine infiltration.
The challenging condition of the spine infiltration caused by the patient's nutrition status is a valid justification for a multiplier applied to the spine infiltration billing code.
