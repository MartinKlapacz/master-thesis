\chapter{Results}
This chapter demonstrates the performance of the billing framework applied to realistic treatment cases.


In this chapter, we apply the framework to treatment cases developed with the assistance of billing experts.
The cases represent realistic treatments that are likely to occur in clinical practice and that are, from a billing perspective, interesting and non-trivial.

Billing experts at \AV subsequently validated the quality of the results.
The framework proved largely capable of generating accurate billings.
However, we also identified limitations of the framework in the results and during the rule-writing process.

This section is structured as follows:
Firstly, we introduce the rules in the rule-base that we make use of to derive our results validated by the billing experts.
This section additionally pictures the usage of the rule features presented in section \addref.
The presented rules also belong to the first version of the rule base used in production by \AV.

Secondly, we introduce the treatment cases.
This involves patient background information, history and outcomes that are part of the patient anamnesis and physical examinations.
Applied medical procedures also characterize these treatments.

For each treatment, we compare the actually derived codes with the expected ones determined by the billing experts.
