\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}
%This chapter demonstrates the performance of the billing framework applied to realistic treatment cases.
In this chapter, we apply the framework to treatment cases developed with the assistance of billing experts.
The cases represent realistic treatments that are likely to occur in clinical practice and that are, from a billing perspective, interesting and non-trivial.
Billing experts at \AV subsequently validated the quality of the results.
The framework proved largely capable of generating accurate billings.
However, we also identified limitations of the framework in the results and during the rule-writing process.

This chapter is structured as follows:
Firstly, section \ref{sec:experimental-rule-base} introduces the rules we preloaded the Billing Server with before performing the actual experiments.
In this work, we can only present a limited set of rules.
A realistic rule-base used in production would need at least 100 rules even with restrictions to specific medical areas.

An additional purpose of this section is to further illustrate the usage of the rule features of \RL.
As a side note, the presented rules are a subset of the rule base that will be employed in production by \AV.
Secondly, in the next sections we introduce the patient cases which we generate billing codes.
This involves patient background information, history and outcomes that are part of the patient anamnesis and physical examinations.
Applied medical procedures also characterize these treatments.
For each treatment, we compare the actually derived codes with the expected ones determined by the billing experts.
