\section{The Billing Framework architecture}\label{sec:the-code-derivation-pipeline}

As mentioned in section \addref rule-based systems require constant maintenance and rule updates.
Uncovered possible edge cases can appear even after system release.

As denoted in \addref one of the requirements for a rule-based system is extendability.
This does not only refer to the rules in the rule-base but also to the framework itself.
It must be straight forward to add new condition fields to the rule language.
This is why
I put great emphasis on extendability during the design of the Billing Framework
by making use of the pattern illustrated in figure \ref{fig:condition-triplet-pattern}.

    \label{fig:condition-triplet-pattern}
\end{figure}

Figure \addref and figure \addref display concrete instances of this pattern.

    % Adjust or remove the space between figures as needed
    \hspace{5mm} % This adds a bit of horizontal space between the figures
