\section{Common Issues with Modern Billing Automation Products}\label{sec:common-issues-with-modern-billing-automation-products}

The previously presented approaches face common issues.
Namely, automatically deriving billing codes from treatment and patient data requires structured data.
This data typically lives as unstructured information scattered across multiple sources such as existing clinical systems or human-readable documents.

When comparing the previously presented applications, one might note their solutions share the following reoccurring pattern.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first step is to collect as much billing-related data as possible and map the unstructured information they find to their own structured data schema.
    \item Given this structured dataset, the systems then apply their own technique to generate billing codes from the data in the schema.
    This own technique is often either AI or rule based or a mixture of both.
\end{enumerate}

This pattern, however, has a set of issues.

Before this text I introduced multiple automatic medical billing products, including 3m,tiplu momo, id clinical context coding.
This is what I have right now, i want to express that this pattern has some issues:
- documents and legacy systems are not guaranteed to deliver all the information that the system needs, documents of miss small details
- external systems track data not in a billing-oriented way. They are designed to track data in a patient documentation way but are designed with a different intention.

do you have other ideas? Maybe papers that may help
