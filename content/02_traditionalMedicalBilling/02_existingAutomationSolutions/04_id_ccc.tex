\subsection{ID Berlin - ID DIACOS / ID clinical context coding}\label{subsec:id-berlin---id-clinical-context-coding}
ID DIACOS and ID CCC are medical software systems developed by ID Berlin for clinical service documentation and coding support in hospitals \cite{IDBerlin2023}.
ID CCC (ID Clinical Context Coding) supports the medical staff by providing patient and diagnosis overviews and allowing quick service documentation.
It is integrable with existing clinic information systems.
ID Clinical Context Coding (ID CCC) supports ID DIACOS in improving the accuracy of medical coding within clinical documentation \cite{IDBerlin2023}.
It enhances the coding process by performing semantic text analyses of digital and digitized human-readable documents.
It identifies hidden services provided during treatment and generates medical codes, supporting the manual coding process of billing professionals.
