\subsection{Flobotics}\label{subsec:flobotics}
Flobotics is a company specialized in the automation of repetitive, rule-based tasks within the medical cycle using Robotic Process Automation (RPA).
This also includes billing-related processes such as patient registration, bill creation, claim generation, and claim submission to insurers.
I had the opportunity to interview Karl Mielnicki, Co-Founder and Lead Architect at Flobotics.
The following information is based on the insights from this expert interview.
It's important to note that Flobotics main focus is the automation of repetitive tasks within the medical field and less on the implementation of complex billing systems.
Nonetheless, they have experience with a project where they designed a simplified billing code generation process for pain treatments.
This was a simplified billing automation task within a small domain and a restricted set of available codes.
The engineers at Flobotics solved this with a basic token text search, exemplifying a straightforward method for automated code derivation.
This experience highlights that billing optimization can also mean the automation of manual processes.
It shows that in certain simple scenarios, automatic coding is solvable in a basic yet effective manner.
