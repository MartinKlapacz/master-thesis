\subsection{Flobotics}
Flobotics is a company specialized in the automation of repetitive, rule-based tasks within the medical cycle using Robotic Process Automation (RPA).
This also includes billing related processes such as patient registration, bill creation, claim generation and claim submission to insurers.
I had the opportunity to interview Karl Mielnicki, Co-Founder and Lead Architect at Flobotics.
The following information is based on the insights from this expert interview.

However, it's important to note that Flobotic's main focus is not the implementation of complex automated billing systems.
Nonetheless, they have implemented a simplified code generation process for pain treatments, which is a scenario with only a reduced number of available codes.
This was achieved through a basic token search in the texts, exemplifying a straightforward method for automated code derivation.
This experience highlights that billing optimization can also mean the automation of manual processes and that in certain simple scenarios,
coding can be solved in a basic yet effective manner.
