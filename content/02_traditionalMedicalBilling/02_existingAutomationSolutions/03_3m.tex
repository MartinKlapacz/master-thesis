\subsection{3M - SmarteKI}\label{subsec:3m---smarteki}
The 3M SmarteKI system is a software tool designed for both inpatient healthcare settings, aiming to streamline clinical billing by automating and simplifying it.
This subsection is based on the product information white paper published by 3M in 2020\cite{3mSmarteKI}.
Its primary focus is on easing the complexity of DRG and PEPP coding, helping healthcare workers efficiently manage billing.
SmarteKI integrates with various healthcare information systems already employed in German clinics.
It gathers and processes essential billing data, including patient visits, diagnoses, lab results, and other pertinent information.
The system also uses advanced AI to analyze medical documents like physician letters and consultation reports.
It collects billing-relevant information from these sources and transforms it into a structured data schema.
Similarly to Momo (Tiplu), it collects data from medical documents and external services and transforms it into structured data.
It employs AI-based as well as rule-based algorithms for billing generation and plausibility checks.
3M regularly updates its rules with input from healthcare providers and insurers,
This way it keeps it aligned with the latest billing rules and regulations.
