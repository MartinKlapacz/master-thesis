\chapter{Billing in the German Healthcare System}\label{ch:billing-in-the-german-healthcare-system}

In the German healthcare system, billing is a critical component that ensures the smooth functioning of medical services.
Patients in Germany can have statutory or private insurance.
There are different regulations and catalogs for both insurance types.
The most important coding catalogs are the Einheitlicher Bewertungsmaßstab (EBM) for statutory insurance and the Gebührenordnung für Ärzte (GOÄ) for private insurance and self-payers.
Both are essentially a collection of services covered by insurances.
Each service has an identifying billing code, a description, as well as conditions and an associated number of points.
Both use a point system to quantify the value of medical services.
A point translates to a monetary value, enabling inflation adjustments.
Subsections \ref{sec:einheitlicher-bewertungsmastab-(ebm)} and \ref{sec:gebuhrenordnung-fur-arzte-(goa)} cover both catalogs in detail.

We firstly cover catalog-specific information and general catalog characteristics, focussing on those relevant for the billing framework.
Next, we depict all condition types living in the catalogs as structured meta-data that we need to consider for automatic billing generation.
The framework can automatically parse existing meta-data condition information from the catalog and evaluate it.
This makes it unnecessary to include them in any rules, which saves a lot of effort.
