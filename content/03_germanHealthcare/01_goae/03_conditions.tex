\subsection{GOÄ Catalog Condition Types}\label{subsec:goa-condition-types}
The great flexibility associated with German private billing is a consequence of the design of the GOÄ.
It only defines a single condition type in a structured way.

Code exclusions are the only structured condition types in the GOÄ.
The scope for this exclusion is the current billing.
There are more conditions on GOÄ codes that, however, only exist as unstructured free text.
There is, unfortunately, no direct way to make use of these unstructured conditions as we do in the EBM.
Instead, code derivation for private treatments will be mostly based on rules and less on structured catalog conditions.
