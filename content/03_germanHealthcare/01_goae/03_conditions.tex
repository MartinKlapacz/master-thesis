\subsection{GOÄ Catalog Condition Types}\label{subsec:goa-condition-types}


\section{Conditions}\label{sec:goae-conditions}
Code exclusions that are bound to the current treatment billing are the only structured condition types in the GOÄ.
There are more conditions on GOÄ codes which, however, only exist as unstructured text.
There is, unfortunately, no direct way to make use of these unstructured conditions as we do in the EBM.
Section\ref{sec:rule-based-approach} introduces a new approach to effectively solve this issue.
