\subsection{Quantity Functions}\label{subsec:quantity-functions}
In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of a billing rule.
Not only which codes are part of the billing, but also their quantity is critical information.
In the previous section, we explained how the billing framework derives a set of applicable billing codes.
In this section, we generalize the framework such that it returns each code in combination with its quantity.
We extend the general rule schema by introducing the concept of quantity functions.
Similarly to rule conditions, quantity functions are subcomponents of a rule.
The framework evaluates quantity functions of rules for a\code{RuleEvaluationInput}.
Formally, quantity functions are functions that map an \REI to a natural number.
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:quantity-function-natural}
    f_{quantity}: \code{RuleEvaluationInput} \longrightarrow \mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
Billing code quantities typically rely on two types of billing information.
Subsection\ref{subsubsec:quantity-derivation-from-procedure-information} and\ref{subsec:quantity-derivation-from-durations} explain these sources.

\subsubsection{Quantity Derivation From Procedure Information}\label{subsubsec:quantity-derivation-from-procedure-information}
The so-called Spine Infiltration is a procedure, that includes injections into spine nerves.
Billing experts use \goa{255} for this medical service.
Procedure block \code{SpineInfiltrationMsg} represents this procedure.
However, \goa{255} typically applies once for each spine injection the practitioner actually provided.
Therefore, a spine infiltration can include multiple injections at different localizations.
The system should not only be able to derive \goa{255} for a provided spine infiltration, but should also be able to derive the correct quantity of \goa{255} codes as the number of injections.
To illustrate this example, it is worth mentioning that the human spine consists of three primary regions \cite{BOGDUK2016675}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The cervical spine, the thoracic spine, and the lumbar spine.
    The cervical spine comprises the uppermost part of the spine, which is the neck and head.
    \item The thoracic spine, located in the middle, has twelve vertebrae attached to the rib cage, providing stability and structure to the upper body.
    \item Lastly, the lumbar spine at the lower back is made up of five larger vertebrae, designed to bear the body's weight and provide flexibility and movement.
\end{itemize}
Each region has well-defined localizations that can be targets for injections.
The \AVS stores the data of a spine infiltration in a \code{SpineInfiltrationMsg} procedure block.

The following code snipped displays a simplified version of it.
\lstinputlisting[
    language=protobuf3,
    style=protobuf,
    caption={Relevant localizations in a spine infiltration},
    label={lst:spineInfiltration},
]{code/proto/spineInfiltration.proto}


\code{SpineInfiltrationMsg} has a nested message\code{NerveRootBlockMsg}.
\code{NerveRootBlockMsg} contains the messages, \code{CervicalSpineMsg}, \code{ThoracicSpineMsg}, and \code{LumbarSpineMsg}.
These messages represent the before-mentioned sections of the human spine.
Each variable in these nested messages is of type \code{Laterality} and represents injections at the respective localization alongside the spine.
The laterality of an injection refers to the specific side or sides where the practitioner performs the injection.
This can be either on the left, right, or both sides.

To get the total number of injections, the system would need to peek into the nested messages \code{CervicalSpineMsg}, \code{ThoracicSpineMsg} and\ code{LumbarSpineMsg} and compute the total number of injections from the laterality values.
Additionally, the framework needs to be able to understand that \code{LATERALITY\_NONE} refers to zero and \code{LATERALITY\_LEFT} as well as\code{LATERALITY\_RIGHT} refer to one injection.
\code{LATERALITY\_BOTH} refers to two injections.
It is important to assign quantities to enum values.

\subsubsection{Quantity Derivation From Durations}\label{subsec:quantity-derivation-from-durations}
Many GOÄ codes specify not only a service content but also a time range.
If provided services exceed that time range the respective code can be billed more than once.

\goa{21: Incoming human genetic counseling, per commenced half-hour and session} is an example for such a code.
If the counseling takes one hour and 10 minutes, \goa{21} can be billed 3 times.
Similar codes are \goa{61: Assistance in the medical service of another doctor (Assistance), per commenced half-hour}
and \goa{85: Written expert opinion involving an effort exceeding the usual extent – possibly with scientific justification –, per commenced hour of work}
Codes that with that characteristic often end with \("\)per commenced hour\("\) or \("\)per commenced half-hour\("\) to indicate the time range.
Those are comparably simple cases.

\mete{Section D: Anesthesia Services} contains a specific class of edge case that use time ranges.

\goa{462: Combined anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, up to one hour} and \goa{463: Combined anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, each additional commenced half-hour}
both denote the same procedure provided, but as their names suggest, they distinguish between different periods of service provision.
\goa{462} is applicable only once per procedure.
On the other hand, code \goa{463} covers each additional half-hour beyond the initial hour.
Its billing number is variable and depends on the total duration of the anesthesia.
\goa{463} excludes the first hour of service provision, already covered under code \goa{462}.

The GOÄ distinguishes between \goa{462} and \goa{463} because of the following reasons.
\goa{462} covers both the induction and the maintenance of anesthesia for the first hour.
This is the most critical phase involving continuous administration of medication to make sure the patient remains asleep.
The time after the first hour typically requires only maintenance of anesthesia and is therefore less critical.
\goa{463} applies to subsequent commenced half-hours after the first hour and is therefore lower priced than \goa{462}.


Anesthesia services frequently use this pattern of code groups referring to the same provided procedure but distinguishing between service periods.
Equivalent examples are \goa{460/461}, \goa{476/477} and \goa{478/479}.
\goa{473, 474 and 475} are a more special example.
They refer to an initiation and monitoring of a continuous subarachnoid spinal anesthesia, again distinguishing between durations.
\goa{473} applies to durations shorter than five hours, \goa{474} to the subsequent five hours and \goa{475} applies once for the second and every subsequent day.

These examples lead to concrete requirements for the billing framework and underline the importance of \"quantity functions\".
They must be expressive enough to represent and manage the nuances of these examples.
Section \ref{sec:quantity-function-specification} illustrates how users can express these cases using the rule language.
