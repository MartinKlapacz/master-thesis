\section{Rule Language Specification}\label{sec:rule-language-specification}

In this section we formally define the semantics of the rule language, that I called \RL.
The following code snipped \addref shows the higher level fields in a general rule object.

\lstinputlisting[label={lst:lst:rule-root}][

style=json,

]{code/rules/rule-root.json}

\section{Information Scope}\label{sec:information-scope}
Part of this work was
to identify billing-relevant information sources through expert interviews and research in the billing catalogs \addcite.
From a higher level perspective, all found information sources are part of the following domains:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The treatment documentation that contains all medical information of the treatment
    \item Treatment-independent patient information
    \item Treatment-independent practitioner information
    \item Patient history containing all previous billing positions
\end{itemize}
