\section{Experimental Rule base}
In this section we introduce the rule base used for the experimental scenarios in this work.

This section serves the following purpose.
Firstly, this section illustrates real examples of

\begin{itemize}
    \item We firstly introduce real that
    \item We illustrate the usage of language features
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GOÄ}
\subsubsection{Base GOÄ rules}

\subsubsubsection{GOÄ 8}
The following rule defines \goa{8}, which is defined as an \mete{Examination to determine the whole body status, including documentation if necessary}.



\lstinputlisting[

label={lst:goae-8-rule}
]{code/rules/experiments/goae-base-rules-8.json}


\goa{8} is formally defined as an examination of the following organ systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the Skin
    \item visible mocous membranes
    \item abdominal organs
    \item supporting and musculoskeletal system organs
    \item orienting neurological examination
\end{itemize}

Note that we use the \code{requiredPhysicalBlocks} field to express conditions on physical examination blocks.
The rule represents each of the mentioned organ systems as a child node of the root node.
The root node applies an \code{AND} operation to all its sub-children.
Each sub-child represents one of the organ systems required by \goa{8}.
The \AVS does not directly define an organ systems examination
However, we can flexibly define an organ system examination by a logical tree of required physical blocks.
This rule defines a skin examination to be present if a \code{skinTurgor}, a \code{skinColor}, a \code{skinThickness} or a \code{skinChangeExamination} block is present.
We can represent the rest of the organ systems in a similar way using the logical tree pattern.
Additionally there is already a respective single block for the orienting neurological examination.

Note that the rule just checks only for existence of examination blocks and does not impose any field conditions.
Unlike \goa{6}, \goa{8} does not mention any additional examination details.
%\goa{6} is very similar to \goa{8} but much larger as it

\subsubsection{GOÄ Surcharges}

The GOÄ defines surcharges that are easily missed out in praxis.
Section \ref{sec:surcharges} introduces this type of GOÄ codes and mentions a few examples.
The following rules are time related and cover inconveniences linked to service provision times.

\lstinputlisting[

The following surcharges are applicable for very young patients.
