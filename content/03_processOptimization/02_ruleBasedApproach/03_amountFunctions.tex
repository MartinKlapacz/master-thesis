How often a code is supposed to be billed in a billing is also highly relevant.

In the previous section we explained how the billing framework derives a set of applicable billing codes.

However, the question of how often we want to bill a code is also highly relevant.

In this section we are generalizing the framework so that for each billable code, it returns the number of times it should be billed, instead of just indicating whether it is billable or not.
