\section{Conditions}\label{sec:conditions}


Each EBM code is represented by a EBM code record in the EBM dataset.
The KBV maintains an extensive xml schema documentation for the EBM data model.


Part of this work is to understand and identify all conditions that determine under which circumstances a code can be billed or not.
For automated derivation of applicable EBM codes these conditions need to be automatically checked.
In this section we go through all identified relevant EBM conditions, that the billing framework need to check automatically.

\subsection{Authorized Practitioner Types List}

The EBM maintains an extensive specification of what type of practitioners are allowed to bill which EBM codes.
For that it defines the two axes medical specialization and service area.

All values for service area of a practitioner are
\begin{itemize}
    \item Specialist (Facharzt)
    \item General Practitioner (Hausarzt)
    \item Specialist-General Practitioner (Fach- Hausarzt)
    \item Authorized Physician (Ermächtigter Arzt)
\end{itemize}

The EBM distinguishes 206 medical specializations.
Possible service medical specializations are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item TG Hematology (TG Hämatologie)
    \item Specialist/Consultant in Neurosurgery (FÄ/FA Neurochirurgie)
    \item Specialist/Consultant in General Surgery (FÄ/FA Allgemeine Chirurgie)
    \item TG Vascular Surgery (TG Gefäßchirurgie)
    \item Subspecialty Neuropediatrics (SP Neuropädiatrie)
\end{itemize}

Formally, each EBM code specifies a set of points from the space spanned by those two axes.
If and only if the practitioner's service area and medical specialization pair is an element of that set, they will be authorized to bill that EBM code.

\subsection{Code Justification List}
Some EBM codes can have a code justification list.
A justification is one of the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An OPS code identifying a procedure conducted in this treatment.
    \item An ICD10 code of a diagnosis given to the patient during this treatment
    \item Another EBM code that is part of this billing
\end{itemize}
A code justification list condition holds if and only if it is empty or at least one code of the three justification categories is present.
Localization specific OPS codes are combined with a localization identifiers (left, right or both sides).
For example the EBM code \meco{31658} has the ops number \meco{5-184.1} in combination with the \meco{B} localization identifier in its code justification list.
For example, \meco{OPS 5-184.1} is listed in combination with the \meco{B} localization identifier and is thus a possible justification code for \meco{EBM 31658}.
This means, applying the billing code \mete{Postoperative Behandlung Hals-Nasen-Ohren VI/2a} (\meco{31658}) i.e. \mete{Postoperative treatment of ear, nose, and throat (ENT) VI/2a} to a \mete{plastic correction of protruding ears through excision of soft tissues} is only possible if both ears were operated on.

The idea behind EBM codes being justifications for other EBM codes is the following.
There are EBM codes with a very general description.

\subsection{Amount Condition}

Another class of conditions are amount conditions.
EBM codes can be limited in how often the code can be billed in a specific time context.
Generally, the KBV defines the following time contexts that are relevant for the EBM:
\begin{itemize}
    \item
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Exclusion List}\label{subsec:exclusion-list}

\subsection{Administrative Gender}\label{subsec:administrative-gender}
EBM codes that contain that condition type can only be explicitly applied for a specific gender.
The number of gender-specific EBM is 150.
Most gender-specific EBM codes come from the fields of gynecology and urology.

\subsection{Form Type List}\label{subsec:form-type-list}

\subsection{Obligate Service Content}\label{subsec:obligate-service-content}

\subsection{Additional Input Information}\label{subsec:additional-information}
Form Type lists are code specific additional input fields.
The KBV defines 35 different additional input information types.
An EBM code can define a subset of these as required additional input information.
This requires the practitioner to add more information to the billing.
Effectively, the billing framework obligates the practitioner to add the required additional information for billing codes that otherwise are perfect billing candidates.
This can be assured by displaying the inputs with the correct data types in the front-end.
\todo{Provide a example}
In the current version of the EBM only few additional input types are actually used.
Those are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finish time
    \item OPS number
    \item ICD code
    \item BSNR
\end{itemize}
