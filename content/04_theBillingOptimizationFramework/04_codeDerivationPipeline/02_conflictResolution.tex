\section{Post-Derivation Code Conflict Resolution}

The following condition fields cause post-derivation code conflicts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \code{excludedTargetCodes}: This condition causes conflicts the conclusion code of the rule and all codes
    \item \code{isSingleBillingPosition}: this condition causes conflicts between the respective code and the rest of the codes causing a star-topology conflict graph
    \item \code{isSingleBillingPositionIfPractitionerIsDoctor}: This condition also causes conflicts between the respective code and the rest of the codes causing a star-topology conflict graph
\end{itemize}

The issue is that the framework evaluates each rule independently.
Each rule evaluation happens isolated from the rest of all rules.
