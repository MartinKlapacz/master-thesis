\paragraph{performerIsDoctor}
The \code{performerIsDoctor} condition is a boolean condition field that allows to impose conditions on the practitioner type.
The current version of the \AVS supports the following practitioner types:


\lstinputlisting[
    language=protobuf2,
    style=protobuf,
    caption={\code{AbnormalitiesExaminationResult}},label={lst:AbnormalitiesExaminationResult}]{code/proto/roleTypes.proto}

Given the rules in code snippet \ref{lst:performerIsDoctor}, \code{code1} would hold if the practitioner had the role \code{ROLE\_TYPE\_DOCTOR}
or \code{ROLE\_TYPE\_HEAD\_DOCTOR}.
Otherwise, \code{code2} would hold.
This condition is relevant for \goa{1} and \goa{2}, which are only applicable by doctors.
